**About Singapore:**  
Singapore is a multi-racial and multi-cultural nation with a population of around 5.6 million, located in Southeast Asia. It is an island city-state, occupying merely 278 square miles of land area, which makes it one of the most densely-populated nation in the world.

**Reason of map choice:**  
Singapore is my choice for this project because I grew up there. With my familiarity with this area, I thought the exploration using MongoDB will be very interesting and exciting.
